# The lab

The purpose of this lab is to practice modeling with statistical and machine learning. The focus is on ISLR Ch. 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization. 

***

Throughout the lab, there will be buttons like the one below. These provide answers to questions in the text.

`r hide("Click me")`
<img src="http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kKdgdeuO2M08M/giphy.gif" />
`r unhide()`

***

There will also be some short questions for you to fill in.

The primary function of these questions is to work as checkpoints for yourselfâ€”a kind of receipt that you are following along and understand what you are doing. The exact format of the questions may differ, but they are all <span style="color:blue">__blue__</span> when the answer is missing or wrong, and they turn <span style="color:green">__green__</span> when you enter the correct answer.

***

Connect to the database: 

```{r sql_connect, message=F}
library(RMySQL) 
con = dbConnect(MySQL(), dbname = "BnL",
                host = "mysql-1.cda.hhs.se", port = 3306,
                user = "bnl", password = "bnl@sse")
```

We are going to include more predictors this time, by evaluating the class of the item: 

```{r sql_get_cat, message=F}
df = dbGetQuery(
  con, 
  "SELECT 
  item, 
  IF(SUM(returned)/COUNT(returned)>0,1,0) AS is_returned, 
  MIN(class_desc) AS class 
  FROM Products 
  JOIN Transactions 
  USING (item) 
  GROUP BY item")
#use one hot encoding
library(caret)
dmy = dummyVars(" ~ .", data = df)
trsf = data.frame(predict(dmy, newdata = df))
```

*How many features are included in the new dataset?*

`r fitb(ncol(trsf)-2)`

Before starting feature selection, remember to split your dataset (here, called "trsf") into a training set and a test set.

```{r split, echo = F}
set.seed(7313)   # set seed to ensure you always have same random numbers generated
smp_siz = round(0.7*nrow(trsf))
train_row = sample(seq_len(nrow(trsf)),size = smp_siz)  
train = trsf[train_row,]
test = trsf[-train_row,]
```

Please refer to subsection 6.5.2 "Ridge regression and the lasso". Fit a lasso (logit) regression. Use cross-validation to pick the tuning parameter (lambda) and make predictions on your test set. 

*What is the prediction accuracy?*

`r hide("Hints")`
Transform your dataset using the model.matrix-function. Omit missing values. The family is "binomial" and the prediction type is "class". Use alpha = 0 for ridge regression and alpha = 1 for lasso regression; the default is 1.
`r unhide()`

```{r glmnet, echo = F, message = F}
library(glmnet)
x = model.matrix(is_returned ~.-item, na.omit(train))[,-1]
y = na.omit(train)$is_returned
lasso = glmnet(x, y, family = "binomial")
set.seed(7313)   
cv.out = cv.glmnet(x, y, family = "binomial")
bestlam = cv.out$lambda.min
x.test = model.matrix(is_returned ~.-item, na.omit(test))[,-1]
pred = predict(lasso, x.test, s = bestlam, type = "class")
acc = mean(pred == na.omit(test)$is_returned)
#get importance of features, using the model with best lambda 
importance = varImp(lasso, lambda = bestlam)
#calculate only the features where the coefficient is not 0
n = length(importance[importance[,1]>0,])
#order by importance, get the first row-name
importance.sorted = importance[
  order(importance[,1], decreasing = T),
  ,
  drop = F]
most.imp = row.names(importance.sorted)[1]
```

`r fitb(round(acc,4))` (using 4 decimals)

*How many observations are in the omitted the test set?*

`r fitb(nrow(na.omit(test)))` 

*How many items are predicted to be returned?*

`r fitb(length(pred[pred == 1]))`

*How many features are included in the lasso-model?*

`r hide("Hint")`
Use the varImp-function and the model with the best lambda.
`r unhide()`

`r fitb(n)`

*What is the most important feature?*

`r fitb(most.imp)`

If you want to learn more about feature selection, PCA is also one alternative approach. Refer to section 6.5.3 PCR and PLS regression if you want to practice. Certain models can handle many features (as long as we have enough observations) and thus do not require feature selection. What is more, using PCA to remove variance in the bias-variance trade-off instead means loosing interpretability in the prediction accuracy-model interpretability trade-off. The next labs cover models that are interpretable and can handle many features.

***

Great job! You have now chosen a target and predictor variables, accessed data from a MySQL-database and trained machine learning models that use feature selection.

# SLASK

The webex package provides a number of functions that you use in [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given below. Knit this file to HTML to see how it works.

**NOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser. The widgets don't work in the built-in RStudio browser. In the built-in browser, click the "Open in Browser" button to open the file in your operating system's browser.**

## Fill-In-The-Blanks (`fitb()`)

Create fill-in-the-blank questions using `fitb()`, providing the answer as the first argument.

- 2 + 2 is `r fitb("4")`

You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session.

```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- sample(2:8, 1)
```

- The square root of `r x^2` is: `r fitb(x)`

The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don't care about case, use the argument `ignore_case = TRUE`.

- What is the letter after D? `r fitb("E", ignore_case = TRUE)`

If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument `ignore_ws = TRUE` (which is the default) and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable.

- How do you load the tidyverse package? `r fitb(c("library( tidyverse )", "library( \"tidyverse\" )", "library( 'tidyverse' )"), ignore_case = TRUE, width = "20", regex = TRUE)`

You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector.

- Type a vowel: `r fitb(c("A", "E", "I", "O" , "U"), ignore_case = TRUE)`

## Multiple Choice (`mcq()`)

- "Never gonna give you up, never gonna: `r mcq(c("let you go", "turn you down", "run away", answer = "let you down"))`"
- "I `r mcq(c(answer = "bless the rains", "guess it rains", "sense the rain"))` down in Africa" -Toto

## True or False (`torf()`)

- True or False? You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`. `r torf(TRUE)`

## Hidden solutions and hints

You can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button using `hide()` before the solution and `unhide()` after, each as inline R code.  Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the `hide()` function.

If the solution is an RMarkdown code chunk, instead of using `hide()` and `unhide()`, simply set the `webex.hide` chunk option to TRUE, or set it to the string you wish to display on the button.

### Example problem

**Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in `cars` dataset.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
```

`r hide("I need a hint")`
See the *documentation* for `plot()` (`?plot`)
`r unhide()`

<!-- note: you could also just set webex.hide to TRUE -->
